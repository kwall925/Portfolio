        <h2>Biography</h2><br>

        <h3>Capabilities</h3>
        <p>With a firm rooting in HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript, I am most comfortable working with front end technologies.
        Going beyond front end, I also have a firm rooting
        in back-end development learned by creating full-stack
        apps with Rails. I have a basic understanding of UI/UX, which I am
        looking to advance. My passion as a developer lies in
        creating content that is functional
        and visually appealing without being
        overly complicated.</p>

        <h3>Aspirations</h3>
        <p>To become a great front end developer but also have the capabilities to be fully
        autonomous as both a back end developer and web designer.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Having a life-long interest in both history and politics,
        theses are the topics I studied at university. I worked on
        political campaigns, and in both government and law. Additionally,
        my passion for food and cooking have led me to employment as a cook
        at various periods throughout my life, mostly as a way to earn an
        income while studying another field.</p>

        <h3>Current Focus</h3>
        <p>Mastering Vue and becoming a
        "passable"-reword designer</p>

        <h3>Other Interests</h3>
        <p>-Love travel and culture. Regularly read, journal, socialize and
        exercise, cook and see new places</p>
