        <h3>Capabilities</h3>
        <p>With a firm rooting in HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript, I am most comfortable working with front end technologies.
        Going beyond front end, I also have significant exposure
        in back-end development learned by creating full-stack
        apps with Rails. I have a basic understanding of UI/UX, which I am
        currently advancing. My passion as a developer lies in
        creating content that is functional
        and visually appealing without being
        overly complicated.</p>

        <h3>Aspirations</h3>
        <p>To become a <em>great</em> front end developer but also have the capabilities to be fully
        autonomous as both a back end developer and web designer (I am aware that this is not easy and will take a long time).</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Having a life-long interest in both history and politics,
        these are the topics I studied in university. I have worked on
        political campaigns, in government, and in law. Additionally,
        my passion for food and cooking have led me to employment as a cook
        at various periods throughout my life to earn extra income.</p>

        <h3>Current Focus</h3>
        <p>Repetition with Vue JS until it becomes second nature.</p>

        <h3>Other Interests</h3>
        <p>I love travel and culture. I regularly read, journal, socialize,
        exercise, cook, eat and see new places.</p>
