My passion as a developer lies in
creating content that is functional
and visually appealing without being
overly complicated.

Capabilities
With a firm rooting in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript, front end is my bread and butter.
Going beyond front end, I also have a firm rooting
in back-end development learned by creating full-stack
apps with Rails.
