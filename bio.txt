To become a great front end developer but also have the capabilities to be fully
autonomous as both a back end developer and web designer

Background
Having a life-long interest in both history and politics,
theses are the topics I studied at university. I worked on
political campaigns, and in both government and law. Additionally,
my passion for food and cooking have led me to employment as a cook
at various periods throughout my life, mostly as a way to earn an
income while studying another field.

Current Focus
Mastering Vue and becoming a
"passable"-reword designer

Other than Dev
-Love travel and culture. Regularly read, journal, socialize and
exercise, cook and see new places.
